I love writing. I started writing when I found that I was constantly trying to work out all sorts of things in my head alone, and becoming all tangled up. I wrote at [Medium](https://medium.com/@.aravindiyer) and also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aravindiyer/). While I intend to continue doing so, I felt like I needed my own little corner.

Maybe it was driven by feeling, but the sense of space that the idea of having my own website evoked, had me convinced. I was going to make my own website!

## Platform
I thought [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) should be my tool of choice because *everybody* talks about it, and 30% of the web uses it! So I started looking around for WordPress themes and for hosting. Then my brother told me about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and how if you create your Jekyll repository on [Github](https://github.com/), you could host your website for free on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I looked at a few Jekyll themes and I came across [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) which appealed to me with its clean and understated look. I thought, 'ok, let's go!'

At this point, I need to say that Jekyll isn't for everyone. If you have zero or limited development experience, then using Jekyll would present quite a steep learning curve. There are ways in which you can reduce your need to use programming tools - for example, here's how you can [add/edit posts](http://romain.pechayre.me/blog/2014/07/31/jekyll-is-not-only-for-developers/) just using Github's web interface and buttons. Plus, there are tools like [Prose](http://prose.io/#about) (and [others](https://github.com/planetjekyll/awesome-jekyll-editors)) which provide an in-browser editing environment for Jekyll. But, you may find [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) or [Medium](https://medium.com/) easier.

## Getting Started
Jekyll is pretty easy to [install](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), if you already have a development setup. Jekyll needs [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download). On my Mac, these were already available. You can check on your terminal like this:

```shell
$ ruby -v
ruby 2.3.3p222 (2016-11-21 revision 56859) [universal.x86_64-darwin17]
$ gem -v
2.7.6
```

But I went ahead and installed [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and then Jekyll. Rbenv allows management of multiple Ruby versions. This can help with faster builds or ensuring nothing breaks, when you build your site on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/versions/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/#ruby), which may use other versions of Ruby. Since I already had [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, this was easy enough:

```shell
# Install rbenv and setup shell integration
$ brew install rbenv
$ rbenv init
# Install a specific Ruby version, say 2.4.3
$ rbenv install 2.4.3
# Install Jekyll
$ gem install bundler jekyll
```

## Project Organisation
With that done, you can create a new Jekyll website using `jekyll new my-website`. For adding the Minimal Mistakes theme, here is a [Quick-Start Guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/). But after playing around a bit, this is what I finally did:

```shell
$ mkdir aravind-website
$ cd aravind-website
# Initialise a Gemfile
$ bundle init
# Add Jekyll
$ bundle add jekyll
# Add Minimal Mistakes theme
$ bundle add minimal-mistakes-jekyll
# Install gems and dependencies
$ bundle install
```

This created a `Gemfile` for my project and I had an empty project with everything installed. As per the [directory structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) specified by Jekyll, and the [navigation documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/navigation/) specified by Minimal Mistakes, I created the following:

```shell
aravind-website
├── Gemfile                 # Gem requirements
├── README.markdown         # Basic description of my project for Github
├── _config.yml             # Jekyll site configuration
├── _data                   # Theme customisation
│   └── navigation.yml      # Links on Top Navigation Bar
├── _pages                  # Pages controlling site structure and navigation
│   ├── 404.markdown        # Custom 404 page
│   ├── about.markdown      # Basic about page
│   └── home.markdown       # Site homepage
├── _posts                  # All the posts go here!
└── assets                  
    ├── icons               # Site icons/logos/etc
    └── images              # Pictures/illustrations used for posts and pages
```

## Connecting to Github
I am not such a disciplined user of [git](https://git-scm.com/). So I played around a bit on my Mac, before it dawned on me that I need to use git. And so I did. If you are hosting on Github Pages, then you need to create a repository on Github with the name `username.github.io`. Otherwise, it can be anything. In my case, it was `aravind-website`. Then, you can do the following:

```shell
$ cd aravind-website
# Initialise git and add all (or relevant) files
$ git init
$ git add --all
# Commit and add a description 
$ git commit -m "First commit" # Or any other message you like!
# Connect your Github repository at USERNAME/REPONAME and push your files
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/iyeraravind/aravind-website
$ git push -u origin master
```

If you created your repository on Github before actually doing any work on your computer, congratulations! Just do the following instead:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME
$ cd REPONAME
# Start working now!
# Use git add and git commit to save your work.
# Use git push to synchronise with Github.
```

It's a good idea to create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from version control. Here is a [good example](https://gist.github.com/bradonomics/cf5984b6799da7fdfafd).


```yaml
collections:
  music-naka:
    output: true
    permalink: /:categories/:title/
  only-human:
    output: true
    permalink: /:categories/:title/
```
The rest of the posts categorised under Blog, went into `_posts`. This is what I ended up with:

```shell
aravind-website
├── _music-naka               # All music-naka articles go here
├── _only-human               # All only-human articles go here
├── _pages                    # Pages controlling site structure/navigation
│   ├── 404.markdown          # Custom 404 page
│   ├── about.markdown        # About page
│   ├── blog.markdown         # Landing page for blog posts
│   ├── home.markdown         # Site homepage
│   ├── music-naka.markdown   # Landing page for music-naka collection
│   ├── only-human.markdown   # Landing page for only-human collection
│   └── terms.markdown        # Terms of use page
└── _posts                    # All blog posts go here
```

Then I started pulling my content from Medium and LinkedIn. An easy way is to use [Paste to Markdown](https://euangoddard.github.io/clipboard2markdown/) and then edit further.

## Customisation
It is possible that a Jekyll theme is not able to provide *everything* you need, in *exactly* the way you want. After all, the interest of the theme maker is generality, while your use-cases might be quite specialised.

Jekyll themes provide a bunch of useful [layouts and includes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#layouts-and-includes). For customising page layouts or for defining your own includes, the best way is to use folders named `_includes` and `_layouts` in your site repository. If you have include or layout files with the same filename as that used in the theme, then Jekyll will use the versions in your own `_includes` and `_layouts` folders instead of the theme assets. For example:

```shell
aravind-website
├── _includes
│   ├── flexgallery      # Equal height grid of images with different aspect ratios 
│   ├── head
│   │   └── custom.html  # Customised to add favicons and no-index tags
│   ├── masthead.html    # Customised to add site logo
│   ├── related.html     # Customised to suggest a sample of posts from same collection
│   └── video            # Added support for Soundsgood playlist embedding
└── _layouts
    └── draft.html       # Layout for draft posts
```

For customising CSS and fonts, I created a main CSS file `main.scss`, added my font settings in `fontconfig.scss` and my CSS customisations in `custom.scss`, at the following paths:

```shell
aravind-website
├── _sass
│   ├── custom.scss
│   └── fontconfig.scss
└── assets
    └── css
        └── main.scss
```

Then I added the following lines to `main.scss`:

```scss
@import "fontconfig";
@import "minimal-mistakes/skins/{% raw %}{{ site.minimal_mistakes_skin | default: 'default' }}{% endraw %}"; 
@import "minimal-mistakes"; 
@import "custom";
```

This ensures that your intended font definitions are inherited by Minimal Mistakes, and then your custom CSS overrides the definitions in the theme.

## Miscellaneous
Additionally, I completed the following:
1. Site verification with [Bing](https://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/how-to-verify-ownership-of-your-site-afcfefc6) and [Google](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1142414?hl=en).
2. Setting up [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
3. Creating site logo and [favicons](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
4. Adding Open graph image and excerpt for every page and post. Check if your site and its pages preview correctly on [Twitter](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator) and [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/sharing/).
5. Adding site search using [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/). Get a free [community plan](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up/hacker) with Algolia.
6. Configuring hosting on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Read how to deploy from a [Github repository](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/) and how to deploy [Algolia on Netlify](https://community.algolia.com/jekyll-algolia/netlify.html).
7. Configuring comments on a static site using [Staticman](https://staticman.net/) and playlist embedding using [Soundsgood](https://soundsgood.co/).

So there you have it. A number of different steps to complete, but now I have my little corner. It's nice seeing you here. Let me know what you think!
